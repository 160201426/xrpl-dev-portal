# Configure Validator List Threshold

A `rippled` server uses validators that meet a minimum intersection threshold between UNL publishers. This means a server only uses validators that exist on a number of validator lists, as defined by the server owner. {% badge href="https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/releases/tag/2.4.0" %}New in: rippled 2.4.0{% /badge %}

By default, the minimum threshold is calculated as follows:

- floor(`validator_list_keys` / 2) + 1
- If there are only 1 or 2 `validator_list_keys`, the threshold is `1`.


## Modify the Validators File

1. Edit the `validators.txt` file. The recommended installation places this file at:
    ```
    /etc/opt/ripple/validators.txt
    ```

2. Add the following stanza and a valid threshold number.

    ```
    [validator_list_threshold]
    0
    ```

Be sure to save the changes and restart your server.

{% admonition type="info" name="Note" %}If this value is `0` or isn't set, the threshold will be calculated using the default method. The value also can't be larger than the number of `validator_list_keys`.{% /admonition %}
