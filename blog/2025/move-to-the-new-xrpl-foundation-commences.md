# Move to the New XRPL Foundation Commences

_By the XRPL Foundation_

Late last year the initial groundwork for the launch of the new XRPL Foundation was laid, including the [incorporation of the new Foundation](../2024/a-new-era-for-the-xrp-ledger.md) in France. This major milestone has enabled the Founding Members (XRPL Commons, XRPL Labs, Ripple, and XAO DAO) to continue with immediate next steps. In line with this, the migration of assets (listed in an [earlier blog post](../2024/a-new-era-for-the-xrp-ledger.md)) from the previous entity to the newly established Foundation is now underway.

The migration includes the transition of the Unique Node List (UNL) published by the old XRPL Foundation to the new XRPL Foundation. Importantly, any validators and node operators that rely on the old UNL will need to update their configurations to reflect the new Foundationâ€™s infrastructure.

In order to maintain continuous network participation and prevent downtime, validators and node operators will receive additional instructions via various channels to increase awareness.

### Why this Transition Matters

Throughout its history, the XRPL Foundation has played a critical role in maintaining the security and decentralized status of the XRPL by publishing a trusted UNL. Validators and node operators are able to contribute to maintaining an up-to-date, secure, and well-managed network by updating their configurations to the new UNL, ensuring a smoother and more reliable blockchain infrastructure.

The transition to the new XRPL Foundation marks an important step in ensuring the continued stability and security of the XRPL network. Validators and node operators play a pivotal role in this process, their participation is crucial for maintaining a robust and decentralized infrastructure. 

As the migration from the old to the new Foundation progresses, additional support and updates will be provided on XRPL.org to ensure a seamless transition for all participants throughput the process.
