Refer to [Contribute Blog](https://xrpl.org/resources/contribute-blog/) for detailed guidelines and examples.

## Section: Handy Reference

To help you get started quickly, here’s a handy guide to the syntax for some of the most frequently used components in a blog post — perfect for streamlining your writing process.

Choosing an SEO optimized title helps boost your blog post. It is recommended to limit your title to under 50 characters and keep it same as the meta `seo -> title` field for consistency.

To include an internal link, use a relative path.  For example, to create a link to the Contributing Documentation topic, use the following syntax: [Contribute Documentation](../resources/contribute-documentation/index.md).

To include an external link, use the absolute URL instead of a relative path. For example, [Contribute Documentation](https://xrpl.org/resources/contribute-documentation).

To include an unordered list, use the following syntax:

- Item 1
- Item 2

To include an ordered list, use the following syntax:

1. List item 1
2. List item 2


### Sub-section: Including Images In Your Blog Post

To include an image, use the following syntax:

Store your graphics in the `/blog/img` directory. Embed graphics using the syntax:

![image_description](/blog/img/my_image.png)

For example, ![XRPL Developer Portal](/blog/img/docs-iav3/xrpl-docs-home.png) renders as follows.

### Sub-section: Embedding Videos In Your Blog Post

For instructions to embed a video, refer to the [Contribute Documentation](https://xrpl.org/resources/contribute-documentation#videos) topic.
